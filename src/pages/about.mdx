I studied Computer Science at a university and I have professional experience as a TypeScript developer. I can use languages such as Rust, C#, TypeScript or Python to write efficient software. I'm also interested in functional programming and I have experience in using languages like Scala or OCaml. I have a lot of experience in web development and I can use several different frameworks, such as Angular, SolidJS, Svelte or Vue.

I'm interested in Japanese history, spanning from ancient times to the modern era. Additionally, I'm interested in Japanese mythology including, but not limited to, supernatural beings, such as 神, 妖怪, 幽霊, and more. Since 2016, I've been learning Japanese, as I believe that it will allow me to better understand some aspects of Japanese culture. Although I still have a long way ahead of me, I am determined to achieve fluency in Japanese language in the future.
