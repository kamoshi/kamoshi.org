# Welcome!

You have somehow found this little floating rock in the middle of the Internet! Some questions you might have while seeing this are page are…

<Tab title="What is this place?" client:load>
It's just my personal website which I use to play around with webdev and write random stuff. You can find here random stuff written by me, which might or might not be interesting. Who knows.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Why did I make this place?" client:load>
No reason really, it was just a random idea that I had one summer. Afterwards I just started adding more and more stuff in my free time until I got to this point. The styles are all written by me from scratch, by the way :smile:

Now that you're here, please enjoy the transient writings that are currently present, here, at this time, for you. Why "Kamoshi"? It's a pretty long story…

## Interactive map with my Geotagged photos

Throughout the last few years I've been taking photos of random things in random places. I've decided to spend some of my free time geotagging them and I managed to create a map of them. It takes a lot of time to geotag them though, so it can take a while for me to add them all to the map.

## A short guide to the Hanafuda card game
I've been playing Hanafuda for a while now, so I decided to write a short introduction into this interesting card game. I am by no means good at the game, so take everything with a grain of salt, but I feel like it should be enough to get you started.
