# Welcome to my personal website
You've somehow made your way to the internet nexus of my activities - the place where I write and do random stuff! This website is a weird amalgamation of all my various interests and thoughts, so it probably is pretty random at times. It is also a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) continously evolving throughout the time. It can change at any time without prior notice in any way imaginable, be wary of the fact anything here could be deleted or edited.

Now that you've been warned, please enjoy the transient ramblings that are present here at this time. Why "Kamoshi"? It's a pretty long story...

## Interactive map with my Geotagged photos
Throughout the last few years I've been taking photos in random places. I've spent some time geotagging them, and I've been able to create a map of them. It takes a horrendous amount of time to geotag them, and honestly I've forgotten some places, so it will take a while to add at least some of the rest.

[Take me to the map!](/map/)

## A short guide to the Hanafuda card game
I've been playing Hanafuda for a while now, so I decided to write a short guide to the game. I am by no means good at the game, so take everything with a grain of salt, but it should be enough to get you started.

[Take me to the guide!](/posts/)

## Thanks for visiting!
