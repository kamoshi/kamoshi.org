# Welcome to my website!

You have found this little floating rock in the middle of the Internet! Congrats ðŸŽ‰

This is just my personal website, which I use to play around with webdev and write about various topics. These things might or might not be interesting, and there's a chance you might learn a thing or two, but there's only one way to find out!

This place is intentionally a mishmash of things I decided to write on the spur of the moment. It's not meant to be a "professional portfolio" website #6432, to the contrary - the more crude it is the better. I don't care what it is, because I don't need to care, and that leaves me free to experiment with the form.

Now that you're here, please enjoy the transient writings that are currently present, here, at this time, for you. Why "Kamoshi"? It's a pretty long storyâ€¦

## Interactive map with my Geotagged photos

Throughout the last few years I've been taking photos of random things in random places. I've decided to spend some of my free time geotagging them and I managed to create a map of them. It takes a lot of time to geotag them though, so it can take a while for me to add them all to the map.

## A short guide to the Hanafuda card game
I've been playing Hanafuda for a while now, so I decided to write a short introduction into this interesting card game. I am by no means good at the game, so take everything with a grain of salt, but I feel like it should be enough to get you started.
