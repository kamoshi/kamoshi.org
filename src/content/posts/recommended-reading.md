## Programming
- C. Hattingh, *Using Asyncio in Python: Understanding Python’s Asynchronous Programming Features*. O’Reilly Media, Incorporated, 2020.  
  > Very useful book for understanding how async works in practice as opposed to multithreading or multiprocessing. It's directed at Python programmers, but it's useful even if you don't intend to use Python.

- B. Milewski and I. Tabachnik, *Category Theory for Programmers*. Lightning Source UK, 2019.
  > This book touches upon abstract algebra and type theory in a way that is approachable for people with no applied mathematics background. A must-read for anyone interested in functional programming.

## Japanese
- J. Rubin, *Making Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don’t Tell You*. Kodansha International, 2002.  
  > This is possibly the first place I came across that mentioned the existence of the so-called "null subject". The topics presented in this book are mainly useful for beginners struggling to grasp the difference between は and が.
