Humans prove again and again that the greatest threat to humanity is humanity itself, and the greatest threat to a man is another man. With the attack on Ukraine by Russian Federation, once again needless human suffering is bound to happen. Sadly this is not what matters for politicians, for whom human death is just an another statistic.

I can only pray for peace.
