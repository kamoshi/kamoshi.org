Hey, you! Yes, I am talking to you!

I know there is something you think you should be doing, and you regret not
starting doing it those ten-or-something years ago. Surely, you would be so
good at it by now!

Well... what if I told you to start right now?

After all, the best time to `<placeholder/>` was 10 years ago, the next best
time is now.

I know that you know what procrastination is, and I know you are guilty of it
too. Moreover, I know that there is something you would like to do, but for
some reason you just never happen to start doing it.

No, it's not just you.

I'm like that as well, it's quite natural really.

Most people think like "I'll start on Monday" or "I'll start on New Year". They
get ambitious and do it for maybe a few days or so, weeks if lucky, and then
they stop doing it. Then they feel guilty about it, and go back to square one.

I keep seeing people like this all the time. Well, let me reveal a spoiler for
you.

The reality is that this will never work. This cycle simply *never* worked. If
you want to do something you can't pick some magical date away in the future,
and expect to just magically click, just as if you entered some "golden age" in
your life. All this really is just a different form of procrastination, that's
why it will never work for you, as it never did for anyone else, ever.

Do you want to know how to really get it done?

Do it immediately. I mean it, get up and do it.

You want to start exercising? Start right now.
You want to start writing? Write the first page today.
You want to start drawing? Draw right now, anything.

And keep doing it every day.

You can't expect the world to give you a sign to do whatever it is you think
you should be doing. You can't expect anyone to help you carve your own way
ahead. Furthermore, you have to decide on your own it is something you ought to
be doing, and then you should just be doing it.

The day you start actually doing the thing, is the day you finally do it.

走れ！
