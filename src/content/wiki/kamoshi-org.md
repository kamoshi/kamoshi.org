I started working on this website in late July of the year 2021 during my internship as a frontend developer. It was also shortly after I had finished a proper webdev course at my university, what a coincidence! This was probably what gave me the creative spark to jump right into it head-first.

## Humble beginnings

You can see the first ever layout written by hand in plain HTML and SCSS below. I probably don't even have the code for that anymore since I didn't push it into version control until maybe a week later!

As you can see finding a nice palette of colors is not actually my greatest strength, however, if you look long enough, and squint hard enough, you can still see the resemblance! :smile:

I work as a TypeScript developer, but ironically when I started working in this website I decided to make it completely free of JavaScript, and I went to *great* lengths to make it happen. It's a tough thing to accomplish unless you want to have a *very* simple website. As you can see, my website uses JavaScript, so did I give up? Not exactly - I still try to minimize JavaScript. You can see how much of this website still remains functional after you turn off JavaScript, you might be pleasantly surprised...
