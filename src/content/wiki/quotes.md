A collection of quotes I've found pretty memorable.

## On software engineering

> To me it feels like software is a clown fiesta compared to "real engineering" disciplines. The vast majority of progress in computing is on the hardware side. Most code infrastructure is C originally written in the 90s and maintained since. Beyond that you've just got isolated towers of garbage that grow for a decade then we restart at a new low. ~ Arc, 2023.04.30


## On success

> Things like freedom and the expansion of knowledge are beyond success, beyond the personal. Personal success is not wrong, but it is limited in importance, and once you have enough of it, it is a shame to keep striving for that instead of for truth, beauty, or justice. ~ Richard Stallman
