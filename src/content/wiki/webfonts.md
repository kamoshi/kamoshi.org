Here are some websites that make it easy to choose web fonts:

- [CSS Font Stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com/)
- [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/)

Unfortunately, the main issue with fonts built into browsers is their dependence on both the browser and operating system you're using. This can lead to missing fonts and variations in how the same font is displayed across different browsers. Take a look at the screenshot below, which demonstrates the differences in rendering the font "Nimbus Sans" on Chrome (left) and Firefox (right). As you can see, the baseline for the font appears much higher on Chrome.

As a consequence, this misalignment causes the user interface to appear broken on Chrome, with the button texts not properly centered.
