  Incredibly flexible static site generator library with incremental rebuilds
  and cached image optimization.

Would you like a site generator that's fast, flexible, and not written in
JavaScript? Do you want the freedom to choose any templating engine you like?
How about writing custom logic in a well-designed language with ADTs and traits?
Or treating the generator as a library, building a truly unique tool tailored to
your needs?

This is exactly what I wanted for myself, so I built it. And now, you can have
it too.
