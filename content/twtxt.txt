2025-06-26T18:23:00.762Z    Hello world! I decided to try to create a microblog of sorts, and use bespoke [twtxt format](https://twtxt.dev/) as the backend... This way I can avoid having to deal with some services I don't really feel like using.
2025-06-28T11:11:15.072Z    The generator which builds this website was rewritten recently, to make it even more flexible. For now it won't be published on crates.io. I will try to make it even better throughout the summer and add documentation... latest version is always [on GitHub](https://github.com/kamoshi/hauchiwa).
2025-07-04T21:42:15.739Z    Recently I bought Apple EarPods, with [audio jack 3.5 mm connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)), and as it turns out they work perfectly well with not only Linux, but also an Android phone. This is why standardized connectors and components are good.
