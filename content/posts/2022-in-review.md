First of all, happy new year! :smile:

## In retrospect

This year was a pretty good year, I am especially happy that I managed to learn Rust. I also found enough time to do the entirety of the [Advent of Code 2022 in Rust](https://github.com/kamoshi/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/rust/src/solutions), which is really cool. This year I bought some books written in the Japanese language, which felt really magical, as that's something I wished to get ahold of for years. Sadly I didn't have enough time to read them all this year. I have lots of books and other things left to read still.

## Plans for the next year
- Japanese - I would like to focus on Japanese, because it's something that's been dragging on forever by now. It would be cool to finally reach a point where I can comfortably read books, newspapers etc. in Japanese. This isn't really the most important part of my studies, so I have to squeeze it in whenever.
- Koko - I would like to write a programming language, which I named Koko. It doesn't actually exist yet, but I think that it will be a very fun experience if I do end up creating it.
- Haskell - I've been thinking about learning this programming language for a while now, and it seems like one of these languages that are just way too iconic and cool :sunglasses: to pass on. I feel like learning Haskell will be a one of a kind adventure.
- Drawing - I would like to learn to draw, but I already know this will be an extremely time consuming endeavor, so it has to go on the back burner. Unless, somehow, I do find enough time to do it.
