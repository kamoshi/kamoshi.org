I enjoy learning new things.

When I was younger I was lucky enough to be able to play around with computers
and programming languages, but at the time I didn't yet realize how deep it all
really is. I was barely writing my first programs in Lua, PHP, or JavaScript
back then.

When I was about 16 years old, by chance, I came across a bunch of
[Japanese](https://youtu.be/SfnbdZR2KOo) [songs](https://youtu.be/M5xgGWeK1lQ)
and I decided that I should learn this beautiful language. It's one thing to
start learning a language and another to actually follow through and learn it,
and well, I guess I'm just this crazy.

Once it was the time to go to a university I decided to study computer science,
and that is where I actually learned what computer science really is or what
implications it has. I came across language like OCaml and Scala which
absolutely blew my mind.

Throughout the years that I could spend at the university I had the privilege
to learn commonly used programming languages like C#, Java, TypeScript, Python,
C++, and other useful technologies. I also went out of my own way to learn
Haskell and Rust.
