Welcome! In this wiki I'll write about various things which don't really fit into any other place.
This wiki is very much inspired by [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/), as well as [Gwern Branwen's really amazing website](https://gwern.net/), and I do really mean it! It's a marvel.
But these are only some of the inspirations which I am always on the lookout for.
