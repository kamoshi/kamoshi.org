title: 影・陰
---

The core difference lies in whether you are thinking of a projection or a
location.

1. [影]{かげ} - the projected image

This refers to the dark shape produced by an object blocking a light source. It
is the visible 2D manifestation of light obstruction, typically as a silhouette
or trace. This word is also widely used figuratively for influence or lingering
presence

* Focus: The form, the outline, or the literal light-blocking phenomenon.
* Usage: A person's shadow on the pavement, the shadow of a bird flying by, or a
  faint trace of something.

2. [陰]{かげ} - the shaded area

This refers to a space that is shielded from light or from view. It does not
have to be 3D in a literal sense, but it always implies a domain or condition,
not a shape. It is "shade" or "cover." If you are standing in the in [陰]{かげ} of
something, you are tucked away within its protection or concealment.

* Focus: The space, the darkness, or the state of being hidden.
* Usage: The shade of a tree on a hot day, or the "dark side" of a personality.

Hiding and the Concept of "Behind"

If you stand in the [影]{かげ} (projected shadow) of a tree, you are just standing
on dark grass. If you stand in the [陰]{かげ} (shade/back) of the tree, you are
using the tree's physical bulk to hide your body.

This nuance leads to a common Japanese expression:　「お[陰]{かげ}[様]{さま}で」

Usually written in hiragana but rooted in the kanji 御陰, it is used to express
gratitude for a successful outcome, implying that the result was achieved thanks
to the unseen support or "shadow" of others. It evokes gratitude for benefits
received from forces that remain in the background or out of sight.
