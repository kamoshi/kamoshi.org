title: "Japanese"
---

This is crazy when I think about it, I learned all of hiragana in like two days
using some mnemonics from the [Tofugu website][tofugu]. My line of thought was
that if I have to learn that sooner or later, better learn it right away. And I
never had to use romaji as a result, in fact I detest romaji, and avoid it like
fire, because seeing kanji always gives me more context.

There also used to be a drag and drop hiragana learning web app thing that was
quite popular back in like 2016, which I used as well, but it seems that it was
taken down since. It's still playable via [Wayback Machine][wayback].

If I had to choose the one single best decision I ever made when learning
Japanese it's learning hiragana right away.

## Browser extension

I recommend using the [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan) extension
for your favorite browser:
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomitan/)
- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yomitan/likgccmbimhjbgkjambclfkhldnlhbnn) 

You can load external dictionaries such as:
- [Jitendex](https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex) - A better version of JMdict
- [JMnedict](https://github.com/themoeway/jmdict-yomitan#jmnedict-for-yomitan) - Dictionary of Japanese names
- [KANJIDIC](https://github.com/themoeway/jmdict-yomitan#kanjidic-for-yomitan) - Dictionary of kanji

## Reading

The faster you start to read Japanese the better, but starting out feels like
hitting a wall with your head. Luckily there are things such as Satori Reader,
which can help you ease into reading Japanese. The problem in my case is that
Satori Reader costs quite a bit of money, and it isn't always that interesting
or appropriate for my level. In this case one would be better off by reading
native content, but the jump is quite hard...

The thing is, you can also make it slightly easier by emulating the Satori
Reader way by reading native content along with the English translation. You
can for example read a single page of manga, and then read the very same page
of manga in English just to check if you got it right.

This way you can read anything you want, and keep it both interesting and
challenging!
