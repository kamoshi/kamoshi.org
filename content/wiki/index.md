Welcome! In this wiki I'll write about various things which don't really fit
into any other place. This section is very much inspired by [Nikita Voloboev's
wiki][nikiv], as well as [Gwern Branwen's really amazing website][gwern], and I
do really mean it! It's a marvel. But these are only some of the inspirations
which I am always on the lookout for.
