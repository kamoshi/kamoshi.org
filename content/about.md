I studied Computer Science at a university and I have professional experience
as a TypeScript developer. I can use languages such as Rust, C#, TypeScript or
Python to write efficient software. I'm also interested in functional
programming and I have experience in using languages like Scala or OCaml. I
have a lot of experience in web development and I can use several different
frameworks, such as Angular, SolidJS, Svelte or Vue.

I'm interested in Japanese history, spanning from ancient times to the modern
era. Additionally, I'm interested in Japanese mythology including, but not
limited to, supernatural beings, such as 神, 妖怪, 幽霊, and more. Since 2016,
I've been learning Japanese, as I believe that it will allow me to better
understand some aspects of Japanese culture. Although I still have a long way
ahead of me, I am determined to achieve fluency in Japanese language in the
future.


## Q&A

**Q. Why did you create this website?**

I decided to create it as a way to practice my skills, and indeed a lot of what
I currently know about running a website and web development is a direct result
of me working on this. The CSS styles, for example, were all hand rolled by
myself. To simplify everything it's a static website served from Nginx, this
way I don't have to do nearly any maintenance work.

**Q. Can I take a look at the source code?**

Sure thing! The source code is available in
[a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kamoshi/kamoshi.org),
and you're welcome to learn. I have just one request please, if you would like
to use this code for your own website do allow others to learn from it too!

**Q. What's your setup?**

I currently use Arch Linux with KDE Plasma desktop as my daily driver. For
editing code I use Neovim with plugins. I also have a server running NixOS,
it's the same server which serves this website.

**Q. Why do you use Neovim?**

Neovim feels simple and to the point, imagine something between Notepad++ and
VS Code, but awesome. I don't want to use Emacs, because I'm not really a fan
of lisps, and it seems like way too much for my taste.
