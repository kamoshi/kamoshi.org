I enjoy learning new things.

When I was younger I was lucky enough to be able to play around with computers
and programming languages, but at the time I didn't yet realize how deep it all
really is. I was barely writing my first programs in Lua, PHP, or JavaScript
back then.

When I was about 16 years old, by chance, I came across a bunch of
[Japanese](https://youtu.be/SfnbdZR2KOo) [songs](https://youtu.be/M5xgGWeK1lQ)
and I decided that I should learn this beautiful language. It's one thing to
start learning a language and another to actually follow through and learn it,
and well, I guess I'm just this crazy.

Once it was the time to go to a university I decided to study computer science,
and that is where I actually learned what computer science really is or what
implications it has. I came across language like OCaml and Scala which
absolutely blew my mind.

Throughout the years that I could spend at the university I had the privilege
to learn commonly used programming languages like C#, Java, TypeScript, Python,
C++, and other useful technologies. I also went out of my own way to learn
Haskell and Rust.


## Q&A

**Q. Why did you create this website?**

I decided to create it as a way to practice my skills, and indeed a lot of what
I currently know about running a website and web development is a direct result
of me working on this. To simplify everything it's a static website served from
Nginx, this way I don't have to do nearly any maintenance work.

**Q. Can I take a look at the source code?**

Sure thing! The source code is available either in a repository on
[my private Forgejo instance](https://git.kamoshi.org/kamov/website) or
[on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/kamov/website) (mirror), and you're welcome
to learn. I just have one single request please, if you would like to use this
code for your own website do allow others to learn from it too!

**Q. What's your setup?**

I currently use NixOS with KDE Plasma desktop as my daily driver. For editing
code I use Neovim with plugins. I also have a server running NixOS, it's the
same server which serves this website.

**Q. Why do you use Neovim?**

Neovim feels simple and to the point, imagine something between Notepad++ and
VS Code, but awesome. I don't want to use Emacs, because I'm not really a fan
of lisps, and it seems like way too much for my taste.
